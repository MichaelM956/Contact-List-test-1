•	I conducted a series of API tests on a web application called Contact List and subsequently proceeded to carry out UI tests on all 12 available cases throughout the application. 

•	Each of the tests I created produced no errors or failures. In addition, I successfully integrated an Owasp Zap security scan into a new branch within my repository and submitted a pull request to merge it with my existing main repositories. 


•	The full security scan of the web application https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com took just over six minutes and yielded the anticipated results: Fail-New:0 Fail INprog:0 Warn-New:12 Warn-Inprog:0 Info:0 Ignore:0 Pass:131.

•	 I had to run the test multiple times due to an error message indicating that the time limit had been exceeded for a secondary rate limit, with a requested ID of CC80:56EAA:23D46:240FA:6623098A.
